So you will get more marks if the animation is more involved than one that is very simple. Please do not confuse an elegant solution of a complex problem with a simple problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Interview Mark (10 Marks) \r\n\r\nYou will be asked to explain your work and the end of week 12 or the Monday in study week. This is to ensure that the work is your own. You may be asked (for example) to explain:\r\n\r\n- Any of the code.\r\n- How you decided on your animation.\r\n- How you developed your animation; where did you start first, etc?\r\n- Anything else.\r\n\r\n \r\n#How is the final mark calculated?\r\n \r\n The final mark is calculated by multiplying the three component marks and dividing by 100. This means that each of the marks is used as a multiplier so a weakness in any of the components will negatively affect your grade.\r\n\r\n Example:\r\n \r\n - Structure of code = 80/100\r\n - Complexity of code = 9/10\r\n - Interview Mark = 10/10\r\n - Final mark = (80 by 9 by 10)/100 = 72%\r\n\r\n\r\n#Note\r\nSpecifically, the multiplier effect means that if you do not present for your interview you will receive 0 for the interview and 0% overall. This means you must be avaiable for interview when requested. \r\n\r\n"
