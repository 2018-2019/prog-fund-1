If you have difficulty attempting these, don't worry...we will cover this approach in detail in your next lecture!\r\n\r\n\r\n##Challenge 1\r\n\r\nUsing [Spot Version 3.0](archives/Spot_Version3_0.zip) as a starting point, save this as **lab07_challenge_01**.\r\n\r\nIn this code, you will notice we have the following Spot Constructor:\r\n\r\n~~~java\r\nSpot(float xPos, float yPos, float diamtr){\r\n    xCoord = xPos;\r\n    yCoord = yPos;\r\n    diameter = diamtr;\r\n  }\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nWe want to add some validation rules to this i.e.\r\n\r\n- before setting the diameter, check that the value sent into the constructor is between 20 and 50 inclusive.  If the value sent in is outside that range, set a default value of 20.\r\n\r\n- before setting the xPos and the yPos, check that the value sent into the constructor is  not negative (i.e. >= 0).  If the value sent in is negative, set a default value of 0.\r\n\r\nTest your code to make sure it is behaving appropriately.  \r\n\r\nSave your work and close the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Challenge 2\r\n\r\nIf we add another field to Spot - a String field called **spotName**. (This simply stores the name of the spot). The class now looks like (without the validations done above):\r\n\r\n~~~java\r\nclass Spot{\r\n  String spotName;\r\n  float xCoord, yCoord;\r\n  float diameter;\r\n\r\n Spot(String name, float xPos, float yPos, float diamtr){\r\n    spotName = name;\r\n    xCoord = xPos;\r\n    yCoord = yPos;\r\n    diameter = diamtr;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nand the *main* class looks like:\r\n\r\n~~~java\r\nSpot sp;\r\n\r\nvoid setup()\r\n{\r\n  size (100,100);\r\n  noStroke();\r\n  sp = new Spot( \"SpottySpot\", 33, 50, 30);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid draw()\r\n{\r\n  background(0);\r\n  ellipse(sp.xCoord, sp.yCoord, sp.diameter, sp.diameter);\r\n  println(sp.spotName);\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nCreate a new sketch called **lab07_challenge_02** and cut and paste the above code into it.\r\n\r\nFirstly, run this program. See how the code in the Spot class and the *main* class have changed to cater for the extra field. Can you explain why so many *SpottySpot* are printed to the console?\r\n\r\nThen, add a validation to the constructor that only allows names that are no more than 7 characters long. If the name is too long, the constructor should impose the rule by cutting the spotName string to the first 7 characters. \r\n\r\nTest your code to make sure it is behaving appropriately.  In particular, perform the following tests:\r\n\r\n- enter a name that is 6 characters long...all 6 characters should be stored in the name.\r\n\r\n- enter a name that is 7 characters long...all 6 characters should be stored in the name.\r\n\r\n- enter a name that is 8 characters long...only the first 7 characters should be stored in the name (hint: substring).\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is called **boundary testing** i.e. we are testing just below, exactly on, and just above the boolean condition that we used in the validation.  This is a popular testing approach as a lot of bugs *live* in the boundaries.\r\n\r\nSave your work and close the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
