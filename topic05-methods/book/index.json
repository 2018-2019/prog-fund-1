Navigate to the references section of the processing website and read about these methods.\r\n\r\nIf you are still not fully sure what a particular method is doing, change the actual parameters for it and see the effect on your sketch.  When finished, change the parameter back to the original value. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Coding the draw() method\r\n\r\nMouse and keyboard events only work when a program has draw().\r\n\r\nWithout draw(), the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.\r\n\r\nIn your open sketch, add the draw() method to it.  The body of the method should be empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Coding the mouseMoved() method\r\n\r\nAdd a mouseMoved method that will change the background to a red colour.\r\n\r\nPrint the following text to the display window (not the console):\r\n\r\n- \"mouse was moved\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRun your code.
