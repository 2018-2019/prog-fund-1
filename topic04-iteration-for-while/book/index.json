Note that we will be working through fixing the bugs we discussed in lectures and finish by saving just the completed, bug free version (i.e. 4.4).\r\n\r\nEnter the following code into your sketch (one again, try avoid the temptation to cut and paste the code...the more mistakes you make when writing out code, the more you learn!):\r\n\r\n~~~java\r\nvoid setup() \r\n{\r\n  size(500,400);\r\n  background(0);\r\n  stroke(255);\r\n  fill(45,45,45);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid draw() {\r\n  int diameter = 100;\r\n  if (mousePressed) \r\n  {\r\n    diameter = diameter – 10;\r\n    background(0);\r\n  }\r\n  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, diameter, diameter);\r\n}\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nRun your code.  Is your circle reducing in size?  Repeatedly press the mouse button...do you see a bug?  \r\n\r\n- The diameter variable is declared in the draw() function i.e. it is a local variable.\r\n\r\n- It is only “alive” while the draw() function is running. \r\n\r\n- Each time the draw() function:\r\n    - finishes running, the diameter variable is destroyed.\r\n    - is called, the diameter variable is re-created. \r\n\r\nTo fix this, change your code so that the diameter variable is now global scope: \r\n\r\n~~~java\r\n//The diameter variable is now global scope\r\nint diameter = 100;\r\n\r\nvoid setup() \r\n{\r\n  size(500,400);\r\n  background(0);\r\n  stroke(255);\r\n  fill(45,45,45); \r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid draw() \r\n{\r\n  if (mousePressed) \r\n  {\r\n    diameter = diameter - 10;\r\n    background(0);\r\n  }\r\n  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, diameter, diameter);\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nRun your code.  Does it work as you would expect now?\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with the code.  In the ellipse method, the width and height are absolute values (the negative sign is dropped...processing only cares about the magnitude).\r\n\r\nTo handle this logic bug, we need to stop reducing the diameter by 10 when we reach a certain value, say 20.\r\n\r\nImplement this code boolean condition in your code and test it again:\r\n\r\n~~~java\r\nint diameter = 100;\r\n\r\nvoid setup() \r\n{\r\n  size(500,400);\r\n  background(0);\r\n  stroke(255);\r\n  fill(45,45,45); \r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid draw() \r\n{\r\n  //boolean condition added to stop reducing the diameter when it reaches 20.\r\n  if ((mousePressed) && (diameter > 20))\r\n  {\r\n    diameter = diameter - 10;\r\n    background(0);\r\n  }\r\n  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, diameter, diameter);\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nDid you notice that it seems the reduction **appears** larger than 10 when we press the mouse?\r\n\r\nWhy?  The default frame rate is 60 refreshes of the screen per second i.e. draw() is called 60 times per second. \r\n\r\nYou can change the frame rate by calling the frameRate() function and passing a parameter of, say, 20.  This will mean draw() will only be called 20 times in a second.  \r\n\r\nMake the change to the framerate:\r\n\r\n~~~java\r\nint diameter = 100;\r\n\r\nvoid setup() {\r\n  size(500,400);\r\n  background(0);\r\n  stroke(255);\r\n  fill(45,45,45); \r\n  frameRate(20);   //slowed down to 20 refreshes per second.\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid draw() {\r\n  if ((mousePressed) && (diameter > 20)){\r\n    diameter = diameter - 10;\r\n    background(0);\r\n  }\r\n  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, diameter, diameter);\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNow your code should run as expected.  \r\n\r\nSave and close your sketch.  \r\n\r\n"
